How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

there are two types of sign I found 
+ and - 
 
- was used for old text of of that file
+ was used for replacement of the old text

that's how it helps me to see the bug


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

In latest file we always put our currently solved problems. 

But if we again fall into same problem in another program, we can't how did we make the solution

Having easy access to the entire history of a file remind me my mistakes 

and how did I make the solution


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

If I manually choose to commit, others may be thought I do too much commits or less commits because it depends on my judgement call.

But it will be useful for me to understand my logical changes clearly.

However, If versions are automatically saved then it may be save a version which I don't want to make version. It will be
problematic for me and others to understand logical changes.


Learn Point 1 :
===============
Git is the main source

-> In git there are repositories
-> Repository is the part of git

-> Staging area part of git
-> add operates on staging area

-> Clone operates on repository
-> init operates on repository

-> Commit is the part of repository
-> diff and log operates on commit

-> working directory is the offline space where we work
-> status operates on working and staging area


Git checkout -> Git checkout is restoring file in previous version. To any commit we made before. It is useful when we 
face a bug and want to know from which commit it was made.

Learn point 2:
==============

There are three directories

working directory -> where we work offline
staging directory-> where we add files before commiting them
repository-> Final submission of files to git




git add -> this command will add files from working directory to staging area
git commit-> this will add files from staging area to repository with a short statement
git status -> this will show the current status of the working directory and staging area 



git diff -> used to find difference between working directory to staging area.(file or files must be added before)

git diff --staged -> used to find difference between one or multiple files from staging area to latest commit.

git diff id1 id2-> used for find difference between two commits in a repository 

If you want to see diff or diff --staged don't add or commit after modifing the file


Git mainly works in 'master' branch. But if anyone want to test something they can make a branch and checkout that branch to test their codes. It will not make any effect to the master branch.

git branch -> used to check in which branch currently we are in
git branch branch-name -> used to make a new branch
git checkout branch-name -> used to work in that branch


To add local repository to cloud github

-> Make an empty repository on github
-> In terminal go to the local repository you want to push
-> Check there is any remote existed or not by command "git remote"
-> It will be empty if there is no remote
-> Now add remote which will be used to pull and push "git remote add remote-name link-of-the-repo"
-> "git remote -v" used to check the link and remote name used to fetch and push
-> "git push remote-name branch-name" used to upload repository to the cloud.


"git pull remote-name branch-name" use to download repository from cloud to local
