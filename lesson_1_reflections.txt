How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

there are two types of sign I found 
+ and - 
 
- was used for old text of of that file
+ was used for replacement of the old text

that's how it helps me to see the bug


How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

In latest file we always put our currently solved problems. 

But if we again fall into same problem in another program, we can't how did we make the solution

Having easy access to the entire history of a file remind me my mistakes 

and how did I make the solution


What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

If I manually choose to commit, others may be thought I do too much commits or less commits because it depends on my judgement call.

But it will be useful for me to understand my logical changes clearly.

However, If versions are automatically saved then it may be save a version which I don't want to make version. It will be
problematic for me and others to understand logical changes.


Learn Point 1 :
===============
Git is the main source

-> In git there are repositories
-> Repository is the part of git

-> Staging area part of git
-> add operates on staging area

-> Clone operates on repository
-> init operates on repository

-> Commit is the part of repository
-> diff and log operates on commit

-> working directory is the offline space where we work
-> status operates on working and staging area


Git checkout -> Git checkout is restoring file in previous version. To any commit we made before. It is useful when we 
face a bug and want to know from which commit it was made.

Learn point 2:
==============

There are three directories

working directory -> where we work offline
staging directory-> where we add files before commiting them
repository-> Final submission of files to git
