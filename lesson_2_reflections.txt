Learn point 2:
==============

There are three directories

working directory -> where we work offline
staging directory-> where we add files before commiting them
repository-> Final submission of files to git




git add -> this command will add files from working directory to staging area
git commit-> this will add files from staging area to repository with a short statement
git status -> this will show the current status of the working directory and staging area 



git diff -> used to find difference between working directory to staging area.(file or files must be added before)

git diff --staged -> used to find difference between one or multiple files from staging area to latest commit.

git diff id1 id2-> used for find difference between two commits in a repository 

If you want to see diff or diff --staged don't add or commit after modifing the file


Git mainly works in 'master' branch. But if anyone want to test something they can make a branch and checkout that branch to test their codes. It will not make any effect to the master branch.

git branch -> used to check in which branch currently we are in
git branch branch-name -> used to make a new branch
git checkout branch-name -> used to work in that branch


To add local repository to cloud github

-> Make an empty repository on github
-> In terminal go to the local repository you want to push
-> Check there is any remote existed or not by command "git remote"
-> It will be empty if there is no remote
-> Now add remote which will be used to pull and push "git remote add remote-name link-of-the-repo"
-> "git remote -v" used to check the link and remote name used to fetch and push
-> "git push remote-name branch-name" used to upload repository to the cloud.


"git pull remote-name branch-name" use to download repository from cloud to local
